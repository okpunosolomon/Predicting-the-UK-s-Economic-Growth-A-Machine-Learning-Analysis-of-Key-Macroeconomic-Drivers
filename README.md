---

### 👷 Unemployment  
![Unemployment](https://github.com/okpunosolomon/Predicting-the-UK-s-Economic-Growth-A-Machine-Learning-Analysis-of-Key-Macroeconomic-Drivers/blob/main/Visuals/Time%20Series%20Plot%20of%20Unemployment.png)

**Interpretation:**  
The steady fall in unemployment highlights an adaptable labor market and improved job retention post-recessions, are both strong signs of a resilient economy.

---

### 🏭 Industry  
![Industry](https://github.com/okpunosolomon/Predicting-the-UK-s-Economic-Growth-A-Machine-Learning-Analysis-of-Key-Macroeconomic-Drivers/blob/main/Visuals/Time%20Series%20Plot%20of%20Industry.png)

**Interpretation:**  
The decline in industrial output is linked to the UK’s strategic shift from manufacturing to service-based industries, consistent with developed economies globally.

---

### 💷 GDP per Capita
